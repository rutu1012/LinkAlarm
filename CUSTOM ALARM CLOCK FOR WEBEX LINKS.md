# CUSTOM ALARM CLOCK FOR WEBEX LINKS

In the digital era, especially during this pandemic, people switched to the online mode of learning. The custom alarm clock is very beneficial.
* For attending all lectures on time
* Getting notified for the upcoming lectures and meetings
* Donâ€™t have to memorize the class time schedule
* Important dates and events reminder can be set

To develop this we make use of Web Scraping which is a data scraping used for extracting data from websites.

To help with web scraping the python package Selenium is used with which we can extract the time from the Webex site and set the alarm for the schedule.

With the given code we could set schedule in two ways:
1. Set the schedule of the entire week by adding the day-to-day links to the dictionary.
1. The user can set their own schedule by passing the solo WebEx links
